## PatricksVilla Haines City

### Die Villa

PatricksVilla is nestled in a quiet cul de sac on the gated community of Southern Dunes Golf and Country Club. The south facing pool side of the house overlooks the 12th fairway and unlike many other vacation homes our villa has got no immediate neighbors a fact that guarantees your well deserved privacy.

You don't want to go for a swim in your own private pool only to find that the guy next door is just a few feet away, admiring your beautiful body.

Enjoy the sunshine from early morning till late afternoon.

Southern Dunes is located on Highway 27, seven miles from junction 55 of the I-4. It's ideally placed for exploring all the attractions the Orlando area has to offer and allowing the whole family to have a truly magical holiday, no matter what their pleasures - leisure, golf, park visiting, shopping or nature loving. Whatever your needs, you're only minutes away from it.

Cleanliness is a very very important aspect of your vacation. We are proud of the fact that we keep PatricksVilla to the highest standard when it comes to cleaning. The house is thoroughly cleaned before and after each of our guests and once a quarter we do a spring clean ourselves (if you knew the lady of the house, you would know what this means...). We also ensure that all carpets are professionally steam cleaned once a year.
